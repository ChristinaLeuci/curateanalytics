    Look, aren’t you fucking tired of being told what to wear by billboards featuring a Justin Bieber in some goddamned tighty-whites? Curate can help you wear what you want and look damn good doing it.
    How we do what we do
    Using our proprietary algorithmic process, we can digitize 80% of your wearable wardrobe in under 5 minutes. You don’t have to take a single picture.
